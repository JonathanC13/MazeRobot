# Maze Robot - January 2018 – April 2018

# Media

# Small Description

- This repo was an early one to save a few things.

-	Using an Arduino Nano controlled robot, designed and implemented decision making processes that used infrared and sonar sensors’ data so the robot could self-navigate a line following maze and an obstacle wall maze. 
  <br/> - Line following maze: Used 2 infrared sensors oriented down for navigation
  <br/> - Wall maze: Used 4 infrared sensors oriented parallel to the ground to detect the white walls and an ultra sound sensor oriented foward.<br/>
-	The testing methods used were observing the robot’s behavior during specific situations and the sensor log output.

# End Remark

  The project went well, robotics always interested me and this project was fun. I do regret that through my university time I didn't pursue more courses and extracurricular activities related to robotics. I'm thankful to my teammates for a successful project.
